Primary Star Type and Size: If main world has already been generated, apply
DM +4 if it has atmosphere 4 - 9 or population 8+.
Companion Type and Size: Apply the roll for primary star type as +DM on type,
and the roll for primary star size as +DM on size.
Companion Orbit: A binary companion uses this column as shown; a trinary
companion implements DM +4 on this column. If the orbit location given results
in a position within the star, the orbit is close (just outside the primary).
Maximum Orbits: Apply DM +4 if star size III, DM +8 if star size is la, lb, or II.
DM -4 if star type M; DM -2 if star type K.
Gas Giant: The number present may not exceed the number of orbits in the
system. For size, roll 1D: 3- is large gas giant;4+ is small gas giant.
Planetoid Belt Present and Quantity: DM - number of gas grants in the system,
but may not exceed the number of orbits remaining after gas giants are placed.
